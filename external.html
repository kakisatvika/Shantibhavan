We receive an extremely high volume of requests to visit campus. Though we love to hear from our supporters, we are unable to accommodate most requests, as our school schedule is highly structured for the benefit of our students’ learning. In some instances, we can accommodate a half-day visit to campus. Please note that we require at least 4 weeks notice in order to coordinate a visit. If you are interested in visiting campus, please contact us at info@shantibhavanchildren.org to share your request. </p>
